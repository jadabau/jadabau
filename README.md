# <p align="center">Hello, I'm Jada Bautista! 🎨🌐💻</p>

**Psychology | Visual Communication Design | Artificial Intelligence**

I'm an **undergraduate Ethics Research Fellow** at the **University of Notre Dame**, deeply passionate about **ethical AI, visual branding and identity, and user experience research**. My work focuses on the intersection of **psychology, design, and computing**, exploring how human-centered design can shape safer, more inclusive digital spaces for children. I'm a designer for the Notre Dame Global Center for the Development of the Whole Child, Strike Magazine, and the Filipino-American Student Organization. Currently, I am creating a large-scale exhibition integrating AI in video-projection.
